# TicTacToe

<hr>
<h2>TicTacToe game from Odin Project</h2>
<p>The program works, though I realized some mistakes I made early. I decided to push through with the strategy I was using to get it to work.
The program isn't DRY and there's some verbose and confusing use of conditionals. Also, not effective OOP. One issue is that I packed a ton of
methods in to one ultimate game class. I need to break down functions into more methods. Also clarify some code into simpler form and anticipate
issues earlier. Start with Psuedo Code plans first.</p>
